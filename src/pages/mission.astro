          <p>
            For too long, the industry has been fragmented. Artists struggle to
            get booked. Bookers can't find reliable talent. Everyone wastes
            countless hours on bureaucracy instead of creating.
          </p>

          <p>We believe it doesn't have to be this way.</p>

            <li>
              <strong class="text-bio-white">Clarity over chaos.</strong> Professional
              infrastructure that makes booking simple and transparent.

              <strong class="text-bio-white">Sustainability over hype.</strong> Long-term
              career building, not quick wins that burn out.

            Our Promise
          </h2>

          <p>
            We promise to build tools that serve the community, not exploit it.
            To create infrastructure that empowers artists to focus on their
            art. To connect professionals in ways that reduce friction and
            increase opportunity.
          </p>

          <p class="text-bio-accent font-semibold text-2xl mt-12 text-center">
            Less chaos. More focus. More bookings.
          </p>

          <p class="text-center text-bio-gray-500 mt-12">This is BIO BEATS.</p>
